# ðŸŒŸ SkillVouch - Student Skill-Based Gig Marketplace

## About the Project

SkillVouch is a platform designed for college students to showcase their skills and connect with recruiters or startups for paid gigs. The idea is to create a space where students can build a solid profile, upload their GitHub contributions, apply for gigs, and get noticed by organizations. Recruiters can post gigs, view applicants, and download resumes directly from the platform.  

The goal is to help students land opportunities based on what theyâ€™re good at, making the hiring process easier and more skill-focused.
